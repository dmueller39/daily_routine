## Physical Training

I try to make time for 3 strength workouts and a long run every week. I rarely hit all of them, but most weeks I can do at least 2 out of 4. My main strategy is to make sure I am interested in the workout. I've tuned my routines to omit the exercises that feel boring, so they feel fun to do. It's possible that selecting for enjoyment may have resulted in less effective muscle development, but I believe in my saying that you get 0% benefit out of the workouts you don't do. In other words, if I was planning for more effective but less fun workouts, I might skip them more often and get none of the benefit.

- Legs Day
  - To me this is  the most important, as I am trying to counteract some chronic knee pain I've had since high school.
  - Routine
    - 3x step circuit 
        - 20 step ups, each leg w/ 30lb kettlebell
        - 20 calf raises, each legs 30lb kettlebell
    - 3x bosu circuit
        - 10 goblet squats on flat surface of bosu w/ 30lb kettlebell
        - 10 knee circles, each direction, on flat surface of bosu  no weight
    - 3x leg dip circuit
        - raised leg dips, each leg w/ 30lb kettlebell
    - 3x kettlebell circuit
        - 20 goblet squats w/ 30lb kettlebell
        - 20 reverse lunges, each leg w/ 30lb kettlebell
        - 20 kettlebell swings

- Arms Day
  - This is less important to me, but its good to make sure all your limbs get a workout. Using the TRX band is great because its very easy to adjust the difficulty of a motion in the middle of a set. It generally just means moving you feet in one direction or another.
  - Routine
    - 3x TRX circuit
      - 20x TRX curls (bicep)
      - 20x TRX extension (tricep)
      - 20x TRX presses (pectoral)
      - 20x TRX rows (back)
    - 3x Kettlebell circuit
      - 10x 2 arm overhead extension  (triceps)
      - 10x curls each arm (triceps)
      - 10x bent over rows each arm (back)
      - 10x overhead press (shoulders)

- Balance and Core Day
  - This one is pretty fun, but its also the one I frequently skip. The general theme is building core strength and balance. Furthermore, its 
  - Routine
    - 3x mat circuit
      - 20x plank with kettle bell shift
      - 20x plank with mountain climber
      - 60 sec bridge
      - 20x scissors
    - 3x medicine ball circuit
      - 20x one handed medicine ball toss and catch (the catch is actually the more difficult part of this exercise, and improves dexterity)
      - 20x round the waist each direction
      - 20x figure 8 through the legs each direction
    - 3x TRX band circuit
      - 20x arm extensions from kneeling position
      - 20x leg extensions from a plank position
    - 3x balance circuit
      - 60 secs eyes closed balance on one foot (each leg)
      - 20x kettle bell one leg full body extentsion (with a light kettlebell in hand touch your opposite foot, and them raise your arm over your head at full extension)

- Long Run (70 mins plus)
  - Use a heart rate monito and keep it below 70% max. This will likely mean you run embarassingly slow for the first few workouts. Don't sweat it, you'll start to pick up around the 3rd or fourth workout. If you increase the frequency of this, you'll actually have to maintain a pretty fast pace to keep yourself at 70%. You are training your body to work in the "fat burning" range. This isn't being done as a weight loss technique, but rather a "which fuel should I use during a race" technique. I probably have 10000x as many calories stored as fat as opposed to easy to burn sugar. (if you are very skinny this might be different). Burning fat just means you are using a much larger store of calories. This doesn't matter that much in a 5k. It does matter in olympic distance triathalons, marathons, and is critical to success in an iron man.
  - I generally run in a straight line until I get too bored to go on (or run out of time). THEN I turn around to run back. For me this is the best strategy to make sure I get the extra distance in. If I am doing laps at a track, its too easy to stop at the 50 min mark (a respectably amount of time).
  - I try to keep my head clear when I am running and count my breaths like when meditating. Most of the time I day dream though. When I was training for a marathon, I reimagined the star wars prequels in my head while running. If I ever need to I can start working on episodes 7-9. :p
