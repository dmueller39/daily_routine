# My Daily Routine

**Warning #1** please see my [disclaimer](disclaimer.md).

## Introduction

Building off of the daily routine outlined in Tim Ferris's [Tools for Titans](https://www.amazon.com/Tools-Titans-Billionaires-World-Class-Performers/dp/1328683788/) this is outline of what I ([Daniel Mueller](https://twitter.com/dmueller39)) do on a daily basis in order to maximize productivity, happiness, and well being.

## Morning Routine

This is what I do first in the morning. Typically I try to get all this done before I get to work during the week, or before my kids wake up on the weekend.

- Make My Bed
  - this comes from a book "Make Your Bed" and the simple idea is that if you start off your day be accomplishing a small goal then you will continue with more small accomplishments throughout the day
- Walk Around the Block
  - Since COVID-19 related orders + recommendations to maintain social distance, I am no longer leaving the house for work on a daily basis. However, commuting to work gave me an extra little motivation to get out of bed in the morning, and without that extra motivation I found myself sleeping in and not being my normal active self. Waking up for a walk around the block has been the perfect antidote for this.
- Write in a journal
  - outline
    - _general writing_ There are three broad types of writing that I do: Reflections and analysis (if I've read something interesting the day before), emotional venting (if something is bothering me), and grab bag commentary (if I don't really have anything to say about the previous categoried).
    - _gratitude_ I write about things I am grateful for focusing on people first (my wife + kids come up a lot!), things next (coffee comes up a lot!), and finally opportunities and the time at which we live.
    - _hopes/goals_ I try to write about the things that would make that day great.
  - feeling gratitude has been shown to have [many positive effects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPPPFqsECz0&t=324s), the freeform writing can help me address anxiety. Additionally, there are studies that indicate writing by hand is better for your brain than exclusively using a keyboard or computer.
- Don't break the chain
  - Every morning I make one goal "Don't break the chain". This means a daily habit of making some small progress on a personal goal, such as writing or some side project. "Don't break the chain" supports "you are what you do every day". If I don't break the chain, then
  - This is based on a technique [talked about by Jerry Seinfeld](https://www.writersstore.com/dont-break-the-chain-jerry-seinfeld/).

# Throughout the Day

These are less scheduled, but I try to slot them in earlier in the day. I've found that I get fatigued as the day go on, so if I want my performance on these to be consistent, its best to get them out of the way before lunch.

- nback - working memory training
  - nback training has a lot of research behind it indicating that in improves your working memory [for example](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30006860).
  - I do this with an app on my phone. There are a lot of nback apps out there, but I spend all of my time in an app I built myself. I found that I got frustrated and gave up with the other apps. I knew I wanted to stick with so I started one of my own and I have been working to tune it to my needs. I am trying to compile more extensive notes [here](nback_notes.md).
  - nback training, aside from making certain tasks easier, has helped with the anxiety around context switching. My theory is that because I am training my memory to insert and remove items from the working memory, that the effort involved in switching contexts (from say writing code that does something, to making SQL queries to understand something) has gone down.
