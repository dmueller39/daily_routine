# My Daily Routine

**Warning #1** please see my [disclaimer](disclaimer.md).

## Introduction

Building off of the daily routine outlined in Tim Ferris's [Tools for Titans](https://www.amazon.com/Tools-Titans-Billionaires-World-Class-Performers/dp/1328683788/) this is outline of what I ([Daniel Mueller](https://twitter.com/dmueller39)) do on a daily basis in order to maximize productivity, happiness, and well being.

## Training the Mind

The mind has a lot of similarities with the body. Most of the principles for wellness that apply to the body apply to the mind as well:

- **body** you are what you eat **mind** your mind will be full of the media, social interactions, and other information your brain processes
- **body** you can develop muscles, cardio, flexibility **mind** you can develop memory, reasoning, and store of knowledge
- **body** if you don't train your body it can get out of shape **mind** if you don't train your mind it can get out of shape
- **body** people have differing natural abilities for physical fitness **mind** people have differing natural abilities for mental fitness
- **body** everyone can benfit from investing in their physical wellness **mind** everyone can benfit from investing in their mental wellness
- **body** when done correctly, you get get a feeling of satisfaction and happiness out of physical training **mind** when done correctly, you get get a feeling of satisfaction and happiness out of mental training

In addition to this, physical training does impact your your brain. A quote I love that I found in "Thinking Fast and Slow" is "you think with your body". Therefore a run or a strength workout, or some kind of class is also good for your brain in some ways.

## Goals

In my "untrained" state I tend to the following conditions:

- anxiousness
- overeating
- impatience
- irratibility
- low interaction in conversations (stemming from the following)
  - poor listening / attention
  - poor recall / finding relevant contributions
- unproductive self criticism

My daily routine is designed around improving these things.

There are also positive goals that I am working toward:

- better physical fitness
- becoming a better writer
- building interesting software
- being a good friend
- being a good father and husband

## Morning Routine

This is what I do first in the morning. Typically I try to get all this done before I get to work during the week, or before my kids wake up on the weekend.

- Make My Bed
  - this comes from a book "Make Your Bed" and the simple idea is that if you start off your day be accomplishing a small goal then you will continue with more small accomplishments throughout the day
  - **benefits** moving toward goals
- Bear Crawls
  - I go down to the basement and do 30-40 seconds of bear crawls. I like bear crawls because its multi-limb and requires coordination. Furthermore, I do them forward and backward to make it as challenging as I can. The purpose isn't strength training, but rather just waking up the nervous system.
  - **benefits** wakes up my body and mind
- Write in a journal
  - outline
    - _general writing_ This is best used for when you are dealing with emotions that are occupying your mind. Sometimes I tend to the "I am going to do this or that" type of journaling, but I always try to steer myself back to writing about my emotional state. Focusing on encoding my fuzzy emotions into sentences requires that I take the time to parse them int discrete concepts, instead of just dwelling in them.
    - _gratitude_ I write about things I am grateful for focusing on people first (my wife + kids come up a lot!), things next (coffee comes up a lot!), and finally opportunities and the time at which we live.
    - _hopes/goals_ I try to write about the things that would make that day great.
  - feeling gratitude has been shown to have [many positive effects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPPPFqsECz0&t=324s), the freeform writing can help me address anxiety. Additionally, there are studies that indicate writing by hand is better for your brain than exclusively using a keyboard or computer.
  - **benefits** processing emotions, writing practice, remembering the important stuff
- Meditate
  - I trained myself into meditation using Headspace which I highly recommend if you are looking to start. There are courses that do a good job of getting you ready. However, I eventually got to a point where what I really wanted was a simple timer that I could customize with bells/sounds to mark when I should change my focus.
  - meditation outline
    - deep breathing (3 mins)
    - environment + physical senses awareness (3 mins)
    - body scan (3 mins)
    - breath focus + counting breaths (11 mins)
      - Just keep your attention on your breathing. This is a simple form of meditation, but I find it to be the most reliable. If I am properly focused, it doesn't feel like 11 mins at all.
    - Situational Visualization + 10 breaths (10 mins)
      - So this is where I try to affect my behavior throughout the day. My strategy here is to see in my mind some situation where I can improve my decisions and reactions. One example is late at night when I am hungry and in front of the pantry. I visualize myself perfectly happy and patient and still. Follow that with counting ten breaths. I might follow that up with another situation where my kids are misbehaving. I see myself happy, patient, and loving. The most important part for me is the happy and patient part. If you imagine experiencing negative emotions, that will color the rest of your meditation, and might have the opposite effect that you want.
  - **benefits** This helps with a lot of the items above: impatience, attention span, and breaking myself out of self critical thought loops.
- Working list
  - A handwritten list of things I ought to focus on for the day. Many of these are small contributions to an overall goal that I am working toward, and some of these are items in this routine. I rarely finish all of them, but I rarely don't finish some of them.
  - **benefits** moving toward goals

# Throughout the Day

These are less scheduled, but I try to slot them in earlier in the day. I've found that I get fatigued as the day go on, so if I want my performance on these to be consistent, its best to get them out of the way before lunch.

- nback - working memory training
  - nback training has a lot of research behind it indicating that in improves your working memory [for example](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30006860).
  - I do this with an app on my phone. There are a lot of nback apps out there, but I spend all of my time in an app I built myself. I found that I got frustrated and gave up with the other apps. I knew I wanted to stick with so I started one of my own and I have been working to tune it to my needs. I am trying to compile more extensive notes [here](nback_notes.md).
  - nback training, aside from making certain tasks easier, has helped with the anxiety around context switching. My theory is that because I am training my memory to insert and remove items from the working memory, that the effort involved in switching contexts (from say writing code that does something, to making SQL queries to understand something) has gone down.
  - **benefits** improved thinking, dealing with anxiety
- anki - long term memory training
  - [This fascinating read](https://numinous.productions/ttft/) turned me onto Anki, a memorization program. The days are still early for this, so my position may evolve.
  - I originally tried to exercise my long term memory by memorizing vocabulary words. I was using a vocabulary app which used a very similar scheme to Anki. However I didn't care about vocabular words.
  - I am memorizing decks in the following categories:
    - [software design pattern](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/701549605)
    - internal technical jargon specific to my job (building this from scratch)
    - [writing qualities](writing_qualities.md) (in progress)
  - While memorization is a little bit of a goal, I've been finding that this has benefits for my overall ability to remember. Exercising long term memory with any subject seems to improve recall for all subjects.
  - **benefits** improved study, _possibly_ better conversations

# Evening

- morning coffee prep
  - Morning me always looks back at evening me with kindness if I prep the coffee. It's like a little gift I give myself.
  - **benefits** more time and energy to spend on the other morning routines
- sleep 8 hours
  - **benefits** this has been the most effective habit for combatting irritability
