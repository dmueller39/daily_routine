# My Daily Routine

**Warning #1** please see my [disclaimer](disclaimer.md).

**Warning #2** these notes are messy and incomplete

## Introduction

Building off of the daily routine outlined in Tim Ferris's [Tools for Titans](https://www.amazon.com/Tools-Titans-Billionaires-World-Class-Performers/dp/1328683788/) this is outline of what I ([Daniel Mueller](https://twitter.com/dmueller39)) do on a daily basis in order to maximize productivity, happiness, and well being.

## Training the Mind

The mind has a lot of similarities with the body. Most of the principles for wellness that apply to the body apply to the mind as well:
- you are what you eat / your mind will be full of the media, social interactions, and other information your brain processes
- you can develop muscles, cardio, flexibility / memory, reasoning, and store of knowledge
- if you don't train your body /mind in an ongoing manner, it will get out of shape
- people have differing natural abilities for physical fitness / mental fitness
- everyone can benfit from investing in their physical wellness / mental wellness
- when done correctly, you get get a feeling of satisfaction and happiness out of physical training / mental training

Additionally physical training DOES impact your your brain. A quote I love that I found in "Thinking Fast and Slow" is "you think with your body". Therefore a run or a strength workout, or some kind of class is also good for your brain in some ways.

## Goals

In my "untrained" state I tend to the following conditions:
- anxiousness
- overeating
- impatience
- irratibility
- low interaction in conversations (stemming from the following)
  - poor listening / attention
  - poor recall / finding relevant contributions
- unproductive self criticism

My daily routine is designed around improving these things.

There are also positive goals that I am working toward:
- building myself up physically for a marathon next year
- being a good father and husband
- being a good friend
- building more interesting things (mostly books or software)

## Morning Routine 

This is what I do first in the morning. Typically I try to get all this done before I get to work during the week, or before my kids wake up on the weekend.

- make my bed
  - this comes from a book "Make Your Bed" and the simple idea is that if you start off your day be accomplishing a small goal then you will continue with more small accomplishments throughout the day
- about 30-60s of bear crawls *(I've stopped this, and might remove)*
  - Tim Ferris recommends "10 reps of something". I prefer bear crawls, which is basically walking forward and backward on my hands and feet. I prefer it because its a pretty complicated movement meant to stimulate my brain and tends to wake up more of your body more quickly.
- 1 minute cold shower *(I've stopped this, and might remove)*
  - I struggle with this one, especially in winter, because our house gets incredibly dry. Furthermore, when I do it, the water isn't ice cold, but rather around the 70 F range. (I used a thermometer to help me get a feel for how cold this is.)
- Write in a journal
  - outline
    - *general writing* This is best used for when you are dealing with emotions that are occupying your mind. Sometimes I tend to the "I am going to do this or that" type of journaling, but I always try to steer myself back to writing about my emotional state. Focusing on encoding my fuzzy emotions into sentences requires that I take the time to parse them int discrete concepts, instead of just dwelling in them.
    - *saying* I might synthesize a saying from the freeform section. A recent one was "You lift with your legs and not your back, because your legs are strong. Make sure that you know what your mind-legs are, and that you do mental lifting with those as well."
    - *gratitude* I write about things I am grateful for focusing on people first (my wife + kids come up a lot!),  things next (coffee comes up a lot!), and finally opportunities and the time at which we live.
    - *hopes/goals* I try to write about the things that would make that day great.
  - feeling gratitude has been shown to have [many positive effects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPPPFqsECz0&t=324s), the freeform writing can help me address anxiety. The saying is just for fun! Additionally, writing by hand is better for your brain than exclusively using a keyboard or computer.
- meditate
  - I trained myself into meditation using Headspace which I highly recommend if you are looking to start. There are courses that do a good job of getting you ready. However, I eventually got to a point where what I really wanted was a simple timer that I could customize with bells/sounds to mark when I should change my focus.
  - meditation outline
    - deep breathing (3 mins)
    - environment + physical senses awareness (3 mins)
    - body scan (11 mins)
      - This could be improved. The recommendation is to thing about your motivation for meditating, but that is consistently the most distracting thing to do. I think "I want to be a better dad" and then I think about hanging out with my kids instead of being present.
    - breath focus + counting breaths (11 mins)
      - This is a really simple form of meditation, but I find I like it. If I am properly focused, it doesn't feel like 11 mins at all.
    - Situational Visualization + 10 breaths (10 mins)
      - So this is where I try to affect my behavior throughout the day. My strategy here is to see in my mind some situation where I don't always make good decisions. One example is late at night in the front of the pantry. I visualize myself perfectly happy and uncaring that there is food I shouldn't be eating late at night. Follow that with counting ten breaths. I might follow that up with another situation where maybe my kids are misbehaving. I see myself happy, patient, and loving. Repeat this for any situations you want to handle better.
      - One thing I tried that was visualizing myself resisting these urges (as opposed to happy, patient, and uncaring). This was effective in changing my behavior, BUT it also negated the rest of the value of meditation, and I spent less of my day in a happy state of mind.
  - **benefits** This helps with a lot of the items above: impatience, attention span, and breaking myself out of self critical thought loops. I originally tried meditation to help with anxiety, but it wasn't really able to help me overcome what I was going through at the time. However sometimes when I am having a panic attack, I focus on my breath and stay present, and frequently thats enough to get me past a temporary issue.
- Working list
  - A handwritten list of  things I ought to focus on for the day. Many of these are small contributions to an overall goal that I am working toward, and some of these are items in this routine. I rarely finish all of them, but I rarely don't finish some of them.
  - **benefits** moving toward goals
  
# Throughout the Day

These are less scheduled, but I try to slot them in earlier in the day. I've found that I get fatigued as the day go on, so if I want my performance on these to be consistent, its best to get them out of the way before lunch.

- nback - working memory training
  - nback training has a lot of research behind it indicating that in improves your working memory [for example](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30006860). 
  - I do this with an app on my phone. There are a lot of nback apps out there, but I spend all of my time in an app I built myself. I found that I got frustrated and gave up with the other apps. I knew I wanted to stick with so I started one of my own and I have been working to tune it to my needs. I am trying to compile more extensive notes [here](nback_notes.md).
  - nback training, aside from making certain tasks easier, has helped with the anxiety around context switching. My theory is that because I am training my memory to insert and remove items from the working memory, that the effort involved in switching contexts (from say writing code that does something, to making SQL queries to understand something) has gone down.
- anki - long term memory training
  - [This fascinating read](https://numinous.productions/ttft/) turned me onto Anki, a memorization program. The days are still early for this, so my position may evolve.
  - I originally tried to exercise my long term memory by memorizing vocabulary words. I was using a vocabulary app which used a very similar scheme to Anki. However I didn't care about vocabular words.
  - I am memorizing decks in the following categories:
    - [software design pattern](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/701549605)
    - internal technical jargon specific to my job (building this from scratch)
    - [writing qualities](writing_qualities.md) (in progress)
  - While memorization is a little bit of a goal, I've been finding that this has effects on my overall ability to remember. Exercising long term memory with any subject seems to improve recall for all subjects.

# Evening

- morning coffee prep
  - Morning me always looks back at evening me with kindness if I prep the coffee. It's like a little gift I give myself.
