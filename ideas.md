  - links and thoughts
    - This article https://numinous.productions/ttft/ talks about the opportunity for tools for thought. However it spends a lot of time discussing Anki (not really the purpose of the article, but still) and a highly curated experiment in tools for thought called Quantum country.
    - I recently read this article: https://www.perell.com/blog/2019/12/11/coolest-things-i-learned-in-2019 and authored some Anki cards for some of the points I wanted to commit to memory.
  - Premise
    - What if there was an app that you could point at that piece of writing and it would generate high quality spaced repetition cards for you? Writing your own cards reeks of something that needs to be automated. I would love to be able to point a reader at any technical article I needed to read, or even a technical reference for some library or technology, and be able to generate a pleasant, consistent reading experience, as well as spaced repetition cards for memorizing any of it.
  - Execution
    - This would need a reasonable amount of machine learning to do in a scalable way. The main issue would be building the initial training data set. You would need to be able to summarize the material, and then determine an appropriate point at which to split it for the front and the back of the card.
