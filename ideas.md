# Ideas

- Mnemonic Reader
  - Assumptions and Thoughts
    - People are looking for improved ways to read and remember information. For instance if you are learning a new software library, maybe you want to read an introduction to it and memorize the most important functions. Or perhaps it is a research paper that needs to be more efficiently read and understood. This article https://numinous.productions/ttft/ talks about the opportunity for tools for thought. It's primary example (quantum country) is a curated example of something that satisfies above. I found myself wanting a way to automatically generate articles in the format of quantum country with preexisting material.
    - I recently read this article: https://www.perell.com/blog/2019/12/11/coolest-things-i-learned-in-2019 and authored some Anki cards for some of the points I wanted to commit to memory. It was a rather mechanical process, and something that might be automatable.
  - Vision Statement
    - Make learning any subject simple and lasting
  - Premise
    - What if there was an app that you could point at that piece of writing and it would generate high quality spaced repetition cards for you? What if it would inject those cards in the middle of your reading experience, so you could decide whether you wanted to learn them or not? Writing your own cards reeks of something that needs to be automated. I would love to be able to point a reader at any technical article I needed to read, or even a technical reference for some library or technology, and be able to generate a pleasant, consistent reading experience, as well as spaced repetition cards for memorizing the most important pieces of it.
  - Execution
    - This would need a reasonable amount of machine learning to do in a scalable way. The main issue would be building the initial training data set. You would need to be able to summarize the material, and then determine an appropriate point at which to split it for the front and the back of the card.
- Book Clubs
  - Assumptions and Thoughts
    - Leisure reading is going down: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/06/29/leisure-reading-in-the-u-s-is-at-an-all-time-low/
    - Reading is frequently cited as having good benefits for your brain: https://thebestbrainpossible.com/reading-improves-brain-memory-stress/
    - Social Media Influencer is increasingly seen as a real career opportunity https://talkinginfluence.com/2019/08/13/being-an-influencer-is-a-career-choice-not-just-a-hobby/
    - Social media is creating an echo chamber around traditional media events. I am a bigger follower of commentary on Star Wars movies (and other big tent pole franchises) than I am of the actual movies themselves. The shared experience of discussing these events is what I value.
  - Vision Statement
    - Bring people together through shared experiences
  - Premise
    - Allow anyone to start a paid subscription bookclub and provide a platform for the social reading of books. Provide a fraction of the subscriptions as compensation for the service of running the book club. Let influencers drive the conversation of what to watch and read instead of waiting to react to big media events.
    - This has a natural expansion to movie clubs, music clubs, video game clubs etc. (video games are actually pose the biggest challenge to this format, but given their growth are likely the biggest opportunity)
  - Execution
    - This is a nice cross section between a Netflix style media subscription service, Patreon (which allows you to give to creators), and a traditional social media outlet.
    - This shouldn't be seen as competing with Twitter, Youtube, and other open social media services. It would be meant to be complement
- Movie Gif
  - perform a text search for any movie, actor, action, dialog, etc and get gifs automatically.
  - Examples:
    - "Alfred Molina rubbing his fingers in Indiana Jones"
    - "Andy Garcia catching the baby carriage in untouchables"
