  - intro to the conceptual combination
  - simple written example
  - effort vs depth
  - "omit needless words" how a lot of words can have zero effect on the depth of a concept
  - "add depth" how a few words can increase the depth of a concept
  - available effort (different people have different capacities for volume)
  - automatic laziness (the brain is always trying to do the same work with less effort)
- Writing Qualities
  - every writing quality and how it maps to our model for conceptual combination

  - Why is twitter popular?
  - Why is Snap MORE popular?
- Book + Ebook format

## NOTES FROM A YEAR AGO:

Units of Meaning

how does the brain recognize and build up a unit of meaning? (Ray Kurzweil/other research)
Thesis: A person typically has a max volume for any one unit of meaning that they can build.
Hard to use - creates a unit with a very broad base thus constraining the depth of complexity
Easy to use - creates a unit with a narrow base thus allowing for much deeper complexity

- Part 1: Media Simplicity
- Part 2: Familiarity
- Part 3: Object Permanence

Conceptual Combination Part 1: Simplicity

I wanted to share some reflections on a hackathon project I recently worked on. One of the goals of the project, called BookClub, is to reduce the cognitive load of reading long form text (ie novels). It is meant to help your brain spend more time understanding the language and meaning of what you are reading, as opposed to wrestling with the media. This might sound surprising, but a great way to prototype this was to leverage the excellent design decisions in messenger/work chat. I built a bot that served a small piece of a book per message:

I completed the project, and started using it. (I struggled to get anyone else to use it, but thats a story for another day...) Things were working really well over Thanksgiving weekend, until one night I spent several hours reading on my phone, and I got eye strain. This seemed like a massive setback. I wanted to keep reading, and thought of my e-paper Amazon Kindle. Sadly, I charged it and loaded up the book, expecting that this spelled the end of BookClub.

It was immediately awful. I tried using it for the night and found that I sort of skimmed over the words and was not building the vivid model of the story and its characters in my head. After a few hours of reading this way, I got much less interested in the book. Later on I returned to my phone and using the book club bot. My interest shot back up, and it seemed like things looked good again for BookClub. But I had to ask:

What's going on here?

How the Brain Creates Concepts

You brain composites simpler ideas into a more complicated ones. All languages are based on this. Here's a super simple example.

- Dog => A dog.
- Dog + Running => A running dog.
- Dog + Running + Car => A dog running after a car.
- Dog + Running + Car + Limp => A dog with a limp running after a car.

Each of the bullets is its own concept, and each time you combine it with another concept, that becomes a new concept entirely. Furthermore each concept becomes a little more complex as you add to it.

The term for this process is “Conceptual Combination”

Complex can be a loaded term in our organization, so depth might be a better word overall, but I think that complex will actually work for my next point.

How Media Helps You Build Concepts

Let's build concepts of similar complexity:

Our brains perform Conceptual Combination so naturally it's like breathing, and we don't really notice it. However, breathing is work. If you are standing on top of Mount Everest where the air is very thin, you will notice how much work breathing is. Conceptual combination is also work.

You can think

- A model for how the brain constructs meaning
  - primitive elements are composed into more complicated elements
  - some recognition is automatic, and some recognition is manual (requiring processing power)
  - a single unit of meaning can be generated, but in any one person the area of a unit is relatively constant.
  - If your brain is occupied with too many automatic steps then there is less “area” for use in manual processing.
  - If your brain does not have the “area” for manual processing it may miss the meaning.
- Simplicity
  - Instagram posts vs stories
    - What if the tags and elements were switched from stories an posts
    - stories would be too boring
    - posts would be too complicated
    - Because a story requires fewer automatic steps to process, there is more “area” that can be occupied by interactive elements
    - Hypothesis: “there are more interactive elements used when the image is simple, there are fewer interactive elements when the image is complex or subtle”
    - Creating a story isn't a simple process
  - BookClub vs Kindle vs Physical Books
    - Assume that a sentence is a unit of meaning. (This isn't how all writing works, but its useful to think about it this way for now)
    - Engaging your motor cortex increases the number of automatic steps.
    - Kindle decides on page breaks based on how the text will look. But it does not care at all about breaking up a unit of meaning.
      - Tried reading a few chapters using the kindle and I enjoyed them less, read more quickly, and found myself getting less interested in the books overall.
    - Physical Books are edited and typeset and proofed by editors and authors.
      - Hypothesis: Manually typeset books are prone to not break up important ideas or quotes across pages, especially if it requires a page turn.
    - BookClub
      - The default unit is a sentence, and moving on from a sentence is where you engage your motor cortex.
      - The UI of a single unit is extremely discrete and requires less work from the brain to isolate and keep attention to
- Familiarity
  - I found that I could ONLY finish Great Expectations using Book Club, but Ready Player One the format didn't matter
  - Instagram vs Facebook (people vs things)
  - Ready Player one vs great expectations
  - book club was unfamiliar and got a lot of laughs
  - I did not “get” stories for the longest time
- Object Permanence
  - physical books are the hands down winners
  - Primitive man looking for food
  - memory palace
  - Feed vs Stories
    - feed feels more permanent, because posts have a place
    - stories are ephemeral and have no place. People have a place within the reels tray, but their stories are just sort of “there”
  - E readers vs timeline interface
    - Generated map of a novel???? (no, but its fun to think about)
- Everyone wants a more efficient unit of meaning that provides more depth for less investment
  - The popularity of Story Elements indicates that there is a desire for deeper interactions.
  - My motivation for building BookClub was due to my inability to read anything other than very “light” books, despite wanting a lot more depth in my media diet.
