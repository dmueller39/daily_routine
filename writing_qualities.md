# Writing Qualities

I am in the process of improving my writing. One approach I am taking is attempting to understand all the properties writing can have that affect its overall quality. In other words, you can't work to improve one of these qualities without having learned it. This list is inspired by [this quote](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7727997-he-singled-out-aspects-of-quality-such-as-unity-vividness).

## Unity
The state of forming a complete and pleasing whole, especially in an artistic context. "The concepts presented in the piece have a tight connection to each other which gives it unity and cohesion."
## Vividness
Producing powerful feelings or strong, clear images in the mind. "The carefully selected details of the description gave the room a vividness in the minds of the reader."
## Authority
The power to influence others, especially because of ones commanding manner or ones recognized knowledge about something. "The research and experience of the author gave her writing authority on the subject she was writing on."
## Economy
Careful management of available resources. Sparing or careful use of something. "Omitting needless words gives your writing an economy which readers will appreciate."
## Sensitivity
Careful use of appropriate words that build the correct concepts in the mind of the reader. Understanding the thoughts of the reader in order to build up the right concepts in their mind. "The writer tried to show sufficient sensitivity when discussing the topic of gender pay equality."
## Clarity
The quality of being coherent and intelligible. "For the sake of clarity each of these subjects is described separately."
## Emphasis
Special importance, value, or prominence given to something. Stress laid on a word or words to indicate special meaning or importance. "The writeup discussed many effects of the new product, but it put emphasis on the overall feeling of health on the part of the consumer."
## Flow
The property of a group of words that indicates a continuous connection between how subgroups are written. "The rhythym of the sentences gave the piece an excellent flow."
## Suspense
A quality in writing that arouses excited expectation or uncertainty about what may happen. "The author asked some intriguing questions to build a little bit of suspense around what would have been a dry subject."
## Specificity
The property of a concept that describes how abstract or concrete it is. "The author was not specific about the renovations that were being made until they mentioned that the kitchens and bathrooms were being gutted and replaced."
## Precision
How closely writing represents the intended concepts and information. "The kids were tired after their afternoon." vs "The kids couldn't do much after walking 4 miles through the airport." 
## Proportion
Proportion in writing can be defined as the amount of details you give, and the time you spend giving them, versus the importance of those details and the length of the scene. [link](https://www.universalclass.com/articles/writing/writing-improvement-proportion-your-writing-details-for-impact.htm) 
## Depth
Depth is the level of emotional and intellectual connection that you can have with a piece of writing. "a dog running" < "a dog chasing a car" < "a dog with a limp is chasing a car"  
## Positivity
The amount of positive vs negative language that is used. This does not mean being positive in spite of facts, but rather phrasing things in a positive manner when possible and appropriate. "Use positive language because it improves the brightness of your words" vs "Don't use negative language because it makes your writing dim and dark."
## Contrast
The level of difference between concepts or phrases.
