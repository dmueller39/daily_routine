# My Daily Routine

## Introduction

Building off of the daily routine outlined in Tim Ferris's [Tools for Titans](https://www.amazon.com/Tools-Titans-Billionaires-World-Class-Performers/dp/1328683788/) this is outline of what I ([Daniel Mueller](https://twitter.com/dmueller39)) do on a daily basis in order to maximize productivity, happiness and well being.

## Training the Mind

Your mind has a lot of similarities with body. Most of the principles for wellness that apply to your body apply to your mind as well:
- you are what you eat / your mind will be full of the media, social interactions, and other information you consume
- you can develop muscles + cardio / you can develop your memory, reasoning, and thinking
- if you don't train your body in an ongoing manner, it will get out of shape / if you don't train your mind in an ongoing manner, it will get out of shape
- some people have a more natural ability for physical fitness / some people have more natural ability for mental fitness
- everyone can benfit from investing in their physical wellness / everyone can benefit from investing in their mental wellness
- when done correctly, you get get a feeling of satisfaction and happiness out of physical training / when done correctly, you get get a feeling of satisfaction and happiness out of intellectual training

Additionally physical training DOES impact your your brain. A quote I love that I found in "Thinking Fast and Slow" is "you think with your body". Therefore a run or a strength workout, or some kind of class is also good for your brain in some ways.

## Goals

In my "untrained" state I tend to the following conditions:
- anxiousness
- overeating
- impatience
- irratibility
- low interaction in conversations (stemming from the following)
  - poor listening / attention
  - poor recall / finding relevant contributions
- unproductive self criticism

My daily routine is designed around improving these things.

There are also positive goals that I am working toward:
- building myself up physically for a marathon next year
- being a good father and husband
- being a good friend
- being a valuable employee
- building more interesting things (mostly books or software)

## Morning Routine 

This is what I do first in the morning. Typically I try to get all this done before I get to work during the week, or before my kids wake up on the weekend.

- make my bed
  - this comes from a book "Make Your Bed" and the simple idea is that if you start off your day be accomplishing a small goal then you will continue with more small accomplishments throughout the day
- about 30-60s of bear crawls
  - Tim Ferris recommends "10 reps of something". I prefer bear crawls, which is basically walking forward and backward on my hands and feet. I prefer it because its a pretty complicated movement meant to stimulate my brain and tends to wake up more of your body more quickly.
- 1 minute cold shower
  - I struggle with this one, especially in winter, because our house gets incredibly dry. Furthermore, when I do it, the water isn't ice cold, but rather around the 70 F range. (I used a thermometer to help me get a feel for how cold this is.)
- Write in a journal
  - outline
    - This is best used for when you are dealing with emotions that are occupying your mind. Sometimes I tend to the "I am going to do this or that" type of journaling, but I always try to steer myself back to writing about my emotional state. Focusing on encoding my fuzzy emotions into sentences requires that I take the time to parse them int discrete concepts, instead of just dwelling in them.
    - I might synthesize a saying from the freeform section. A recent one was "You lift with your legs and not your back, because your legs are strong. Make sure that you know what your mind-legs are, and that you do mental lifting with those as well."
    - I write about things I am grateful for focusing on people first (my wife + kids come up a lot!),  things next (coffee comes up a lot!), and finally opportunities and the time at which we live.
    - I try to write about the things that would make that day great.
  - feeling gratitude has been shown to have [many positive effects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPPPFqsECz0&t=324s), the freeform writing can help me address anxiety. The saying is just for fun!
- meditate
  - I trained myself into meditation using Headspace which I highly recommend if you are looking to start. There are courses that do a good job of getting you ready. However, I eventually got to a point where what I really wanted was a simple timer that I could customize with bells/sounds to mark when I should change my focus.
  - meditation outline
    - deep breathing (3 mins)
    - environment + physical senses awareness (3 mins)
    - body scan (11 mins)
      - This could be improved. The recommendation is to thing about your motivation for meditating, but that is consistently the most distracting thing to do. I think "I want to be a better dad" and then I think about hanging out with my kids instead of being present.
    - breath focus + counting breaths (11 mins)
      - This is a really simple form of meditation, but I find I like it. If I am properly focused, it doesn't feel like 11 mins at all.
    - Situational Visualization + 2 breaths (10 mins)
      - So this is where I train myself a little more. My strategy here is think about a situation where I don't make good decisions (sitting in front of the pantry / work snacks) and then see myself making a good decision. Follow that with counting two breaths. Then another situation is maybe my kids are misbehaving, but instead of getting annoyed, I see myselg being patient. Repeat this for any situations you want to handle better.
  - This helps with a lot of the items above: impatience, attention span, and breaking myself out of self critical thought loops. I originally tried meditation to help with anxiety, but it wasn't really able to help me overcome what I was going through at the time.
